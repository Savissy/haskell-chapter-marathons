**Delivery Route Optimizer**
🔍 Overview
In this project, you will build a Haskell console application that simulates a simple delivery route planner. You’ll use the Maybe monad to handle missing inputs, the list monad to generate delivery combinations, and verify the monad laws in practice.

This project will help you understand and apply the following topics from Chapter 20:

✅ Maybe Monad

📋 List Monad

📐 Monad Laws (Left identity, Right identity, Associativity)

🎯 Objective
Write a Haskell program that:

Accepts a driver name, a warehouse location, and delivery points (comma-separated).

Uses the Maybe monad to safely handle cases where inputs may be missing.

Uses the list monad to generate all valid routes.

Prints each route in the format:
"Driver [name] will deliver from [warehouse] to [destination]"

Demonstrates and prints out Monad Law checks using Maybe.
